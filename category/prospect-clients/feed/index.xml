PDPSC BETA RESOURCE	| </p>
<p>Hello! I am participating developing by early collaboration the beginnings of what is personally a necessary new infrastructure that I among my colleagues have researched to the sturdier rough beta we ‘PDPSC’ any inherit of ‘Propel Digital Personal Service…” now are currently testing. Further its direction in discussion this document being adaptable to technology while bringing with it some progressive incentives for future organizational integrity.<br />
“Not to be selfish it starts we start off with an idea arose dabble concept a sort of “Captains Log” and/or Journal Entry Pool that is protected seeming old fashioned almost in light of todays advent….”<br />
…. with its societally ramped populous insecured inflated medias widely imposing, having aggressed and/or deluded aggressed intellectual property, our creative growth opportunities, contaminate blind corruption of our refining search to experiences we would like part, homage and/or to acknowledge happy, sadness, play, work, fears, horrors, all the fun. Here enough jabbing ethics, personally I am more basher style anyways but there should be room for all sort of people personality joust.<br />
First this announcement should highlight we are currently testing several ideas for workflow productivity being preparing integrations where clients can focus on the less technical direction of the collaborative being introduced presented to collaborative progress making identifiable infrastructures visibly budgeting, placing, and testing for “Collaborative Domain Participation Rewards”.  It may seem vague however to continue below is a rough run down of internal domain participation being assessed as serving a position as priority control point foundationally:<br />
*******Clients by direct interpersonal relation with approved and/or approved transient vendor not simply collaborative approved retail but there also as well approved vendor with managing company for electric share. [Domain Participation: Cold.Call.Service.KYCVerify.Online]
<p>*******Clients by package purchased within the collaborative, packages which during beta are limited to infrastructure areas along lines of insurance, liability with ip rewards,facilities, legal, so forth assessed critical point foundationally. [Domain Pariticipation: PersonalServiceCorporation.io]
<p>•	*******Clients can be involved in governance directly and/or round about fashion in manners that can be assessed for improvements, and/or presented with feedbacks, as well as rewarded to greatly congratulated. This is in preparation gateway legal focus area uniquely accessing permissioning clients more and/or any internal agreements, approved state and announced requisite convene, IP etc. domain participation: Service.Agreement.For.1media.Online</p>
<p>The above are more core “Collaborative Domain Participation Rewards” however PDPSC is in fact the past 1-2 years bounced about the researching and implementing of varying cms/s, varying print publishing strategies formatting in general, we even as well have vetted several of the applicable standard technologies, and made/unmade decision in direction. The resolve is to first focus on “plain utility with web development” where once we are kinetic visibly hobbling a beginning move forward clear vision being founded then to make the integrations in cloud technology, to introduce the fun industry driven initiatives for collaborative writers and artist to assist with project workflows processed initiative objective to a derivative work being merchandised, published, event based.<br />
*******Example of research and implementation is concept client relationship can be more protected refined keeping activity going documented between more than one CMS/s it still is pure concept yet alluded to domain participation:  Cold.Call.Service.KYCverify.online/service-activity</p>
<p>*******More advancing unique process about record keeping, distinct services provided to clients and that perspective client activity as qualitative data useful to new collaborative environments. We also protect those relationships intimacy from hello to working relationship to products being introduced by collaborative effort confirming those participations along the way with block chain technology. One example yet not specific choice domain participation: PingFee.Online</p>
<p>•	*******Initiating the client relationship, assessing client relationship growth, rewarding participations, establishing progressive intimacy with client for activity and product, supporting interest of clients being studios, and bringing value to clients by consolidating organization of relationship to client owned ‘shopable’ byproduct. [Domain Participation: DesignateWallet.com]  (currently uniquely identifies clients as preparation to sort domestic vs. international consumers whereby navigating client obtained pseudonyms and/or original sub/s domain)</p>
<p>**KEEP IN MIND EXACT DOMAINS ARE UNSPECIFIC REFLECTION AREA FOCUSES FOR ORIGINAL AND UNIQUE PROCESSES INVOLVING A “WORK FOR HIRE INTERNALAZING RELATIONSHIP” AND “PARTICIPATION REWARD SYSTEM” FOR ANY SUBSEQUENT DERIVATIVE WORK. THE BUDDING FAR TOO EARLY APPROACH IS CHOICE TO CONSOLIDATE GROWTH EXPERIENCES WITH INTENT PIONEER HYBRID TRADITIONAL BUSINESS ARCHITECTURE MORE ADAPTABLE TO TECHNOLOGY.</p>
